Decode 2048
===========

A clone of the game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) to make it as simple as possible for the purposes of learning how to code.

## Things to Fix

Of course this isn't perfect! Why not try and improve on some features we've purposefully left out?

- Currently you lose if the game board is full. You may still be able to make a move if this is the case. Make it so you only lose when it's impossible to move.
